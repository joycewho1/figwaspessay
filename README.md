Although wasps are commonly perceived as stinging menaces, many, including the fig wasp, not only play important roles in various ecosystems, but also create value for humans. Notably, the fig wasp *Platyscapa quadraticeps* is the sole pollinator of the fig tree *Ficus religiosa*, which is of significant cultural and religious value in Singapore.[^1] The fig wasp’s critical value also contributes to a broader conversation on the often overlooked or misunderstood roles of non-native species in Singapore. It is easy to conflate non-native species with invasive species, despite only the latter being harmful to ecosystems. Instead, many non-native species like *Platyscapa quadraticeps* function as cornerstones in Singapore’s ecosystems, including urban green spaces which themselves are more manicured and distant from the idea of “pure nature” yet also are the most common and preferred form of natural interaction for Singaporeans.[^2] 

## Of Crucial Ecological and Cultural Significance
As its sole pollinator, *Platyscapa quadraticeps* exhibits a reciprocal mutualistic relationship with *Ficus religiosa*.[^3] The fig of *F. religiosa* is monoecious, meaning the syconium (hollow, fleshy receptacle that develops into fruit) is functionally male and female.[^4] When the almost ripe fig is in the male phase, impregnated female wasps will lay their eggs and pollinate the syconium through swift foreleg motions.[^5] *P. quadraticeps* has an adult lifespan of less than two days, within which time they must pollinate the fig ovaries where wasp larvae are raised.[^6] In the wasp’s scientific name, *‘scapa’*, from Latin meaning ‘to drop’, likely references pollen deposition while *‘quad’* hints at the wasp’s foreleg motions, and the root *‘-cep-’*, meaning to take or receive, alludes to the wasp’s mutualistic relationship with the fig tree.[^7]

*Ficus religiosa*, reliant on *Platyscapa quadraticeps*, possesses significant cultural value in Singapore and across Asia. Moreover, valued for its nutritional qualities, figs are not only a popular snack but also used in traditional Chinese medicine prevalent in Singapore.[^8] Dried figs are a common ingredient in respiratory related tonics, and fig bark and leaves can be used for wound treatment.[^9] *Platyscapa quadraticeps* thus plays a hidden but crucial part in maintaining *Ficus religiosa*’s important cultural roles.

## Situating Platyscapa quadraticeps in Singapore’s Dense Cityscape 
*Platyscapa quadraticeps* exhibits wide dispersal patterns, and the population in Singapore is likely part of a continuous regional population spanning temperate and tropical Asia.[^10] *Platyscapa quadraticeps* follows the spontaneous distribution of *F. religiosa* in Singapore across both primary and secondary forests like Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, as well as in the city’s urban green spaces – from the Japanese Garden in Jurong East to Duxton Plain Park in the CBD to Tanah Merah MRT station.[^11]

Urban green spaces (UGS) in Singapore cover over 47% of the city, reflecting its “city in nature” (originally “garden city” and then “city in a garden”) moniker.[^12] UGS are integrated into Singapore’s hot and air, light, and noise-polluted landscape, and are affected by continuous urban development.[^13] Pearl’s Hill City Park’s (PHCP) ecosystem exemplifies that of a typical UGS in Singapore. Located near Outram Park and Chinatown, PHCP was the site of a gambier plantation and hospital in the 1800s before becoming a public park.[^14] Today, PHCP is dominated by non-native birds that are omnivorous generalists such as the Javan Myna (*Acridotheres javanicus*) and Eurasian Tree Sparrow (*Passer montanus*). The park also features a Bodhi tree that has been designated as a heritage tree, meaning *Platyscapa quadraticeps* also inhabits the park.[^15] 

The diversity of species inhabiting the park reflects how the Singaporean public perceives and uses UGS. UGS provide cultural ecosystem services by facilitating recreation (e.g., birdwatching, hiking) and providing a respite from city life.[^16] Indeed, the presence of the heritage Bodhi tree provides a meditative space that the public can enjoy.[^17] However, while the Bodhi tree in the park may be valued, the fig wasps silently serving this cultural good are often undervalued and are likely viewed as a nuisance based on prevailing negative sentiments surrounding wasps. Any lack in addressing threats to the fig wasp’s survivability, however, will also impact the fig tree’s future. 

## From Flight to Plight: Future Challenges to *Platyscapa quadraticeps*
As the climate crisis worsens alongside continual urban development and other escalating anthropogenic environmental pressures, the quality of Singapore’s UGS is at risk. This poses challenges to *P. quadraticeps*, with cascading effects including the potential for a breakdown of the mutualistic relationship between the wasp and tree, which may have drastic effects for UGS that rely on *F. religiosa* as a keystone species.[^18] (Ng et al., 2011; NParks, 2023).
