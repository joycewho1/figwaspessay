Although wasps are commonly perceived as stinging menaces, many, including the fig wasp, not only play important roles in various ecosystems, but also create value for humans. Notably, the fig wasp *Platyscapa quadraticeps* is the sole pollinator of the fig tree *Ficus religiosa*, which is of significant cultural and religious value in Singapore.[^1] The fig wasp’s critical value also contributes to a broader conversation on the often overlooked or misunderstood roles of non-native species in Singapore. It is easy to conflate non-native species with invasive species, despite only the latter being harmful to ecosystems. Instead, many non-native species like *Platyscapa quadraticeps* function as cornerstones in Singapore’s ecosystems, including urban green spaces which themselves are more manicured and distant from the idea of “pure nature” yet also are the most common and preferred form of natural interaction for Singaporeans.[^2] 

## Of Crucial Ecological and Cultural Significance
As its sole pollinator, *Platyscapa quadraticeps* exhibits a reciprocal mutualistic relationship with *Ficus religiosa*.[^3] The fig of *F. religiosa* is monoecious, meaning the syconium (hollow, fleshy receptacle that develops into fruit) is functionally male and female.[^4] When the almost ripe fig is in the male phase, impregnated female wasps will lay their eggs and pollinate the syconium through swift foreleg motions.[^5] *P. quadraticeps* has an adult lifespan of less than two days, within which time they must pollinate the fig ovaries where wasp larvae are raised.[^6] In the wasp’s scientific name, *‘scapa’*, from Latin meaning ‘to drop’, likely references pollen deposition while *‘quad’* hints at the wasp’s foreleg motions, and the root *‘-cep-’*, meaning to take or receive, alludes to the wasp’s mutualistic relationship with the fig tree.[^7]

*Ficus religiosa*, reliant on *Platyscapa quadraticeps*, possesses significant cultural value in Singapore and across Asia. Moreover, valued for its nutritional qualities, figs are not only a popular snack but also used in traditional Chinese medicine prevalent in Singapore.[^8] Dried figs are a common ingredient in respiratory related tonics, and fig bark and leaves can be used for wound treatment.[^9] *Platyscapa quadraticeps* thus plays a hidden but crucial part in maintaining *Ficus religiosa*’s important cultural roles.

## Situating Platyscapa quadraticeps in Singapore’s Dense Cityscape 
*Platyscapa quadraticeps* exhibits wide dispersal patterns, and the population in Singapore is likely part of a continuous regional population spanning temperate and tropical Asia.[^10] *Platyscapa quadraticeps* follows the spontaneous distribution of *F. religiosa* in Singapore across both primary and secondary forests like Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, as well as in the city’s urban green spaces – from the Japanese Garden in Jurong East to Duxton Plain Park in the CBD to Tanah Merah MRT station.[^11]
